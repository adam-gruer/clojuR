# clojuR
Call clojure from R
Explore calling compiled clojure (clojure compiles to java bytecode that runs on the JVM) from R via the rJava interface.
clojure offers 
- persistent, immutable data structures (vector, list, map, set)
which
- support efficient creation of 'modified' versions, by utilizing structural sharing.

this project aims to explore 
1. can it be done?
2. is it fun?
3. is it useful?
